## Equal Voices

Our Vision is to give people a platform to speak their mind about events that affect us as a community, irrespective of background.

There are several examples of structural injustices becoming commonplace, let alone being overlooked - for example, the Untouchables that lasted until India gained independence, and the systemic racism of Black and Latino populations in the US that is ongoing today. We disassociate with these horrific events because it seems so far away from us - and those affected by these events oftentimes suffer silently.

The first step towards tackling a problem is to talk about it - to gather and engage those who are affected by that problem, to generate awareness about the problem, and brainstorm about how to approach it.

This app is also a platform to share untold stories. Many avoid seeking help from Mental Health professionals due to the stigma surrounding it. With more and more voices sounding in support and sharing their experiences, the more comfortable they would be in their own skin.

## What it does

This app can help bridge the gap between communities. It is a way to bring those from vulnerable minorities into the conversation. It is a great opportunity to see a story from a different perspective.

## What’s next for Equal Voices
A few things that we have in mind:
- Get in touch with people who are concerned about the same issues as you via a randomly matched person in a one to one chat
- If a chatroom hasn’t been created by an admin yet, the user may send a request for it to be prioritized
- Have extra security by enabling 2FA via phone verification
- An admin panel to enhance content management
